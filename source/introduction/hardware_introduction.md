## Payload SDK Development Kit
You can get the Payload SDK development kit after becoming a Payload SDK enterprise user. The Payload SDK development kit allows you to explore the Payload SDK features and facilitates quick development. 

The Payload SDK development kit contains the following componentsï¼š

- DJI SKYPORT Adapter  x1
- Payload SDK Development Board  x1
- Round Ribbon Cable 250mm  x1
- Flat Ribbon Cable 30mm  x1
- Ribbon Cable Connector  x3

## DJI SKYPORT Adapter
### Introduction
![](../images/introduction/hardware_introduction/psdk_adapter.png)
The SKYPORT adapter is docked to a M200 series' gimbal port to connect user payloads and UAVs. For the connection of the SkyPort and the payload, see [SKYPORT installation](../guide/adapter_install.html).

## Payload SDK Development Board
The Payload SDK development board helps you explore the Payload SDK features to quickly familiarize yourself with the Payload SDK usage and prototype your application during the preliminary R&D phase. You can port the Payload SDK to your own payload platform later. The Payload SDK development board uses the MCU STM32F407IGT6.
