Before using PSDK to develop payload devices, you should register a DJI account, apply to become a Payload SDK Developer, then purchase a DJI aircraft and **Hardware Dev Kit**. According to the development guide, learn the basic knowledge about DJI aircrafts. Required to the standards, at last, using tutorials and API documents, develop the payload which could be mounted on DJI aircrafts.

## 1. Sign Up

* Make sure that you have read the <a href="https://developer.dji.com/cn/policies/privacy/"> Terms and Policies </a> **carefully** before <a href="https://developer.dji.com/payload-sdk/apply/" target="_blank"> signing up</a> a DJI PSDK enterprise account.

## DJI PSDK Development Guide

#### Preparation

* Learn the basic knowledge and control principles of aircrafts, such as pitch, yaw, roll and throttle.
* Understand the [features](./feature-list.html) that PSDK supported.
* Follow DJI's payload [design standards](../guide/payload-criterion.html).
* Choose [hardware platform](../guide/hardware.html).
* Select [Development Platform](../guide/platform.html).

#### Start to develop

* Before using PSDK to develop payload, please read the content in [Instructions](../workflow/attention.html).
* [Connect](../workflow/device-connection.html) drone, third-party development board, Hardware platform and computer.
* [Install](../workflow/development-environment.html) software, prepare toolchains and libraries.
* [Run](../workflow/run-the-sample.html) the sample to learn how to use various features provided by PSDK.
* Through cross-platform mirgration, [transplant](../tutorial/transplant.html) the payload control program developed based on PSDK to different software and hardware platforms.

#### Develop Payload
* Develop the payload according to the [Tutorials](../tutorial/initial.html) and PSDK API documentation.
* Use [DJI Assistant 2](https://www.dji.com/cn/downloads) and other tools to debug the payload.

## Business Cooperation
Adhere to the concept of openness and mutual benefit, DJI provides developers technical support, payload detection, channel recommendation, and DJI ecological promotion services. We sincerely work with developers and partners to build a good application ecosystem.

* Apply for a license to produce more than 10 payload devices.
* If the payload passed DJI's detection, it will be recommended to third-party partners.
* If payload can pass the inspection of a third-party professional organization, after signing a cooperation agreement with DJI, DJI will carry out more in-depth cooperation with the partner, such as recommending the partner's payload to <a href="https://www.dji.com/cn/products/enterprise#partner-payloads">Global users </a>, etc. For more cooperation matters, please <a href="mailto:dev@dji.com">contact us </a>.
