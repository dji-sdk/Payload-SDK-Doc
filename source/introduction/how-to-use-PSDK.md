## Business Cooperation
Adhere to the concept of openness and mutual benefit, DJI provides developers technical support, payload detection, channel recommendation, and DJI ecological promotion services. We sincerely work with developers and partners to build a good application ecosystem.

* Apply for a license to produce more than 10 payloads.
* If the payload passed DJI's detection, it will be recommended to third-party partners.
* If payload can pass the inspection of a third-party professional organization, after signing a cooperation agreement with DJI, DJI will carry out more in-depth cooperation with the partner, such as recommending the partner's payload to <a href="https://www.dji.com/cn/products/enterprise#partner-payloads">Global Users </a>, etc. For more cooperation matters, please <a href="mailto:dev@dji.com">Contact Us </a>.
