> * This series of documentation introduces the functions of PSDK V2.0.0, as well as the steps and methods of developing payloads using PSDK V2.0.0. If you are still using PSDK V 1.5.0, please download the documentation of [PSDK V1.5.0](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/71a7d383e71a4fb8887a310eb746b47f/psdk/payload-sdk-doc-1.0.zip).

Before using PSDK to develop payloads, please read this document carefully to avoid improper operation and accidental damage to the aircraft, hardware platform or payloads.

## Firmware Upgrade
Before using X-Port or Skyport V2 to develop a payload on the M200 V2 Series, you should use **DJI Assistant 2** to upgrade the drone and hardware platform:

* M200 V2 Series: V01.00.0650 or above.
* Controller GL900A: V01.00.0650 or above.
* DJI Assistant2: V02.00.11 or above, for details to upgrade please see the user's menu of the drone.

> **NOTE**
> * X-Port and Skyport V2 only support **PSDK V2.x.x**.
> * Skyport only supports **PSDK V1.x.x**.
> * DJI recommended developers use **PSDK V2.xx** with **X-Port** or **Skyport V2** to develop payload.
> * If you still use **PSDK V1.xx** and **Skyport** to develop payload, please download the documentation of [PSDK V1.5.0](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/71a7d383e71a4fb8887a310eb746b47f/psdk/payload-sdk-doc-1.0.zip).
